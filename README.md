# BealeCipher
This program encrypts and decrypts messages using the book cipher from the second page of the Beale Papers.

# The lore
According to the legend, the three ciphertexts contain the location of a treasure worth apporximately $43 Million USD. These ciphers were supposedly trusted to Robert Morriss by Thomas J. Beale who later disappeard, these papers were then passed to a friend of Morriss, who many years later in the 1880s, published them after not being able to solve whole mistery. He did however solve the second paper, with the technique implemented here.

## How does it work
+ The cipher uses a book as a key to the cipher.  
+ Each word in the book is counted (starting from 0)
+ The first letter of each word is then represented by their count

For example:
```
